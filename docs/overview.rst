Introduction
===================================

whylogs (https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs) is an open source data quality \
library that uses advanced data science statistics to log and monitor data \
for your AI/ML application. whylogs is designed to scale with your MLOps \
workflow, from local development to production terabyte-size datasets.


Whether you are running an experimentation or production pipeline, understanding the \
properties of the data that flows through your application is critical to the success of \
your ML project. whylogs enables advanced statistical collection using lightweight techniques, \
such as building sketches for data, that enable complex monitoring and data quality checks for your \
pipeline.

Key Features
===================================

* **Data Insight:** whylogs provides complex statistics across different stages of your ML/AI pipelines and applications.

* **Scalability:** whylogs scales with your system, from local development mode to live production systems in multi-node clusters, and works well with batch and streaming architectures.

* **Lightweight:** whylogs produces small mergeable lightweight outputs in a variety of formats, using sketching algorithms and summarizing statistics.

* **Unified data instrumentation:** To enable data engineering pipelines and ML pipelines to share a common framework for tracking data quality and drifts, the whylogs library supports multiple languages and integrations.
  
* **Observability:** In addition to supporting traditional monitoring approaches, whylogs data can support advanced ML-focused analytics, error analysis, and data quality and data drift detection.
