This folder contains example scripts demonstrating whylogs usage.

If you're new to whylogs and want to get your hands dirty, check out the [Getting Started](./basic/Getting_Started.ipynb) Notebook under the `basics` folder!

If you are already a bit familiar, but wanted to check out our integrations and see where else `whylogs` can take you, feel free to check out our [integrations](./integrations/) folder!

The examples in this folder can also be viewed in whylogs' documentation in https://whylogs-v1-doc-dev.netlify.app/examples
