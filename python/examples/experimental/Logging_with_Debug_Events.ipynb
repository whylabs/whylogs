    "Consider the scenario where you may want to record additional information pertaining to your dataset, and maybe you also have some private data that you store separately in your own systems such as a database or filesystem. We do not want the raw private data stored in the dataset profile, but we need a way to trace back to a record for purposes of later debugging if there are alerts or constraint failures related to this data. With DebugEvents you can store small arbitrary JSON along with dataset profiles, and these debug events can be correlated with profiles or other external data by sharing a user supplied `trace_id`. In practice this should be something like a uuid, url or other unique string that you can later use to lookup information that may be stored in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example we setup a toy example where we profile a single test message with whylogs, but also attach to it a debug event. Additionally you can supply segment key value pairs to help partition this debug data, and tags for things like your environment to help make searching and filtering easier in debug scenarios."
