        "In this walkthrough, we'll see how you can use Feast and whylogs together at different parts of your ML pipeline - We'll use Feast to set up an online feature store, and then use it to enrich our serving data with additional features. After assembling our feature vector, we'll proceed to log it with whylogs. As the requests for prediction arrives, the logged input features will be statistically profiled. We will explore these profiles to see what kind of insights we can have.\n",

        "To do so, we'll use a sample dataset of daily taxi rides in NYC, extracted from [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Our final goal could be a prediction requested at the start of a given ride. This prediction could be whether the customer will give a high tip to the driver, or maybe whether the customer will give him a good review.  As an input to the prediction model, in addition to the ride information (like number of passengers, day of the week or trip distance), we might be interested in enriching our feature vector with information about the driver, like the driver's average speed, average rating or avg trips in the last 24 hours, with the hopes of improving the model's performances.\n",

        "The info about the specific ride will be known at inference time. However, the driver statistics might be available to us in a different data source, updated at specific time intervals. We will join these information to assemble a single feature vector by using Feast to set up an online feature store. Feast will materialize the features into the online store from a data source file. This data source will have driver statistic's, according the each driver's ID updated in an hourly basis.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will simulate a production pipeline, where requests for predictions will be made at different timestamps. We'll then log the feature vectors for each request into daily profiles for a period of 7 days. We'll then see how we can compare the obtained profiles for possible data issues or drifts we might have between days."

        "> Note: Even though both features are integers, each feature can be better visualized with different types of visualizations. That happens because integers can be viewed as number, properly, or as a sort of encoding categorical variables. Since the driver's rating has few different possible number, and it wouldn't make sense to group different numbers in a single bin, this feature is better visualized by treating them as categorical variables, and therefore using the `distribution_chart()` visualization."
