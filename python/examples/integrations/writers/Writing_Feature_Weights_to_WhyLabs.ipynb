    "Feature Importance consists of a class of techniques that indicates the relative importance of each feature for a given prediction model. This is done by calculating and assigning a score, or weight, to each feature. Tracking the feature weights of a model can be useful for different reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Insights: By determining which features are more or less important to your task, a domain expert can make informed decisions, such as gathering more data or adding/removing different features.\n",
    "- Model Interpretability: Feature weights can provide insights into which features your model considers more or less relevant, improving the model's interpretability.\n",
    "- Model Upgrading: Feature weights can be the basis of further feature selection processes, removing unnecessary features, improving the maintainability and performance of your model.\n",
