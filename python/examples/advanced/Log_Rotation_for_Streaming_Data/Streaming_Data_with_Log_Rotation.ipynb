    "# Rolling Logs with Streaming Data\n",

    "Now that you've become family with the [\"Getting Started\"](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs/blob/mainline/python/examples/basic/Getting_Started.ipynb) and the basic examples, let's see what else whylogs can be used for! So far, you've seen it ingest rows and dataframes during the logging process, but now let's look at ways to handle large amounts of changing data such as streaming with ... rolling logs! (sometimes also called log rotation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of needing to plan out how you log in intervals with batching we handle all of that for you. The Logger will create your session, log information at the requested intervals of seconds, minutes, hours, or days and at that interval write out your profile to a .bin file and flush the log getting ready to receive more data."

    "#### Why would you want this?\n",
    "Well, logging data throughout a given time period allows a higher grain of precision to your statistical profiles, and having these logs written regularly not only ensures their safety but also allows more options for merging profiles when it comes time for analysis. We'll go into that in depth in the [\"Merging Profiles\"](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs/blob/9618e5dd6570bc484579ec1325f2f512ff56977f/python/examples/basic/Merging_Profiles.ipynb) notebook, but you can also see a simple example of it at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you have multiple intervals per timeline of your analysis. For example, if you want to look at the changes daily taking it at least hourly will help get a good profile estimation. Doing it too frequently where a profile may only have a couple lines is not preferred so play around with the balance that is right for your needs."

    "## Simple Example using Bitcoin Ticker\n",
    "To start off, let's see how logging works; this will be an extremely basic example to show the syntax. We'll get data from BlockChain's ticker as this Jupyter notebook runs. To make you not wait for too long I'll have it run while constantly gathering data and rolling over the file every 20 seconds. This will give enough data for an example for the notebook without making you wait too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data picked is just a pull of the json API from the given website being used over time. This allows for easy streaming into a Jupyter that is quick and consistently changing, but in reality this is where you'd want to hook up your predictive models, larger data, CSV, etc."
