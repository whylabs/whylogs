So far, you've seen it ingest rows and dataframes during the logging process, but now let's look at ways to handle large amounts of changing data such as streaming with ... rolling logs! (sometimes also called log rotation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of needing to plan out how you log in intervals with batching we handle all of that for you. The Logger will create your session, log information at the requested intervals of seconds, minutes, hours, or days and at that interval write out your profile to a .bin file and flush the log getting ready to receive more data."

    "#### Why would you want this?\n",
    "In production, however, data flows into the model in real-time, unbounded by business hours or other natural boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two challenges to monitoring continuous streams of data. The first is segmenting the stream so intermediate results can be made available. The second is scaling the monitoring solution to match the rate at which data is consumed with the rate at which data enters the stream. Monitoring with whylogs can easily meet both these challenges, and still provide complete statistical profile of the entire stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the rolling logs you can get data as it's coming in and it will ingest at whatever rate the data enters without have any slow down or memory problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you have multiple intervals per timeline of your analysis. For example, if you want to look at the changes daily taking it at least hourly will help get a good profile estimation. Doing it too frequently where a profile may only have a couple lines is not preferred so play around with the balance that is right for your needs."

To make you not wait for too long I'll have it run while constantly gathering data and rolling over the file every 20 seconds. This will give enough data for an example for the notebook without making you wait too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data picked is just a pull of the json API from the given website being used over time. This allows for easy streaming into a Jupyter that is quick and consistently changing, but in reality this is where you'd want to hook up your predictive models, larger data, CSV, etc."

As you are logging datasets the session tracks many inputs (done through `why.log()`) into a dataset profile. When we use the rolling logger it will write out the dataset profile to the .bin then flush it to start logging again. This allows you to have that data safely stored in an incremental fashion which you can then merge back together as one piece, individually, or any number.\n",
