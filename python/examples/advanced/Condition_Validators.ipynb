    "With __Condition Validators__, the user is able to evaluate conditions on individual values on real-time scenarios. These checks are done while data is being logged, and can trigger one or multiple actions when these conditions fail to be met. With __Condition Validators__, you are able to define actions where an immediate response is required, such as emiting an alert to key stakeholders, logging specific failures or throwing exceptions. Validators are designed with flexibility in mind, so you are free to customize your actions as well as the conditions that trigger those actions.\n",
