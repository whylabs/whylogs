    "whylogs profiles contain summarized information about our data. This means that it's a __lossy__ process, and once we get the profiles, we don't have access anymore to the complete set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes some types of constraints impossible to be created from standard metrics itself. For example, suppose you need to check every row of a column to check that there are no textual information that matches a credit card number or email information. Or maybe you're interested in ensuring that there are no even numbers in a certain column. How do we do that if we don't have access to the complete data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that you need to define a __Condition Count Metric__ to be tracked __before__ logging your data. This metric will count the number of times the values of a given column meets a user-defined condition. When the profile is generated, you'll have that information to check against the constraints you'll create.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Define additional Condition Count Metrics\n",
    "- Define actions to be triggered whenever those conditions are met during the logging process.\n",
    "- Use the Condition Count Metrics to create constraints against said conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want more information on Condition Count Metrics, you can see [this example](https://nbviewer.org/github/whylabs/whylogs/blob/mainline/python/examples/advanced/Condition_Count_Metrics.ipynb) and also the documentation for [Data Validation](https://whylogs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/data_validation.html)\n"
