Ecommerce Dataset
=================

The Ecommerce dataset contains transaction information of several products for a popular grocery supermarket in India. It contains features such as the product's description, category, market price and user rating.

The original data was sourced from Kaggle's `BigBasket Entire Product List <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/bigbasket-entire-product-list-28k-datapoints>`_ . From the source data additional transformations were made, such as: oversampling and feature creation/engineering.

Versions and Data Partitions
----------------------------

Currently the dataset contains one version: **base**. The task for the base version is to classify wether an incoming product should be provided a discount, given product features such as history of items sold, user rating, category and market price.
The **base** version contains two partitions: **Baseline** and **Inference**

There are 11 possible categories for a given product. In order to get the desired size for the dataset, original data was oversampled for each category with the `Random Oversampling Examples (ROSE) <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-012-0295-5>`_.

The original data didn't contain date and time information. Data was artificially partitioned into separate days in a preprocessing stage for the fabrication of this dataset.

Features Description
--------------------

Target Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are features that are typically targeted for prediction/classification.

.. list-table:: Target Features
    :widths: 20 50 10 20
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Feature
        - Description
        - Type
        - Present in Versions
    *   - output_discount
        - if the purchased product had a discount, bool
        - Target
        - all


Prediction Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These features are outputs from a given ML model. Can be directly the prediction/predicted class or also scores such as uncertainty, probability and confidence scores.

.. list-table:: Prediction Features
    :widths: 20 50 10 20
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Feature
        - Description
        - Type
        - Present in Versions
    *   - output_prediction
        - Random Forest model's prediction for target variable `output_discount`
        - Prediction
        - all
    *   - output_score
        - Class probability for the predicted class
        - Prediction
        - all

`output_prediction` and `output_score` was obtaind by training a Random Forest model with the SKLearn library. Data used to train the model was previously separated and is not present in this dataset.

The remaining partitions (baseline and inference) were each oversampled and split into separate days.

Extra Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are extra features that are not of any of the previous categories, but still contain relevant information about the data.

Input Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are input features that were used to train and predict the prediction features.
