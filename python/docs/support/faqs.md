### What is Data Logging?

Unlike traditional logging which is standard practice in all software systems, data logging is a practice necessary for ML/AI applications. Data logging involves creating a log of statistical properties of the data that flows through an ML/AI application. Checkout our [blogs on parallels between DevOps and MLOps logging approaches](https://medium.com/whylabs/whylogs-embrace-data-logging-a9449cd121d) and on the practice of data logging in data science.


### Can you handle large scale data?

whylogs is built for scale and optimized for massive data sets. With whylogs users can profile massive amounts of data faster than ever before. In our tests, logging 1.2 million rows took 4 seconds and a dataset of 288 million rows x 43 columns took 3.5 minutes! Stay tuned for the upcoming article showing the complete benchmark!
