Datasets
********

whylogs datasets' module provides the user with different datasets to experiment with.

The API allows fetching data in batches of different time periods, and also provides a clear distinction between baseline and inference (production) datasets.

The goal is to provide a standardized collection of datasets to study and explore tasks such as: drift detection, outlier detection, data quality/validation, time series and data monitoring in general.

Each dataset may contain different versions that are more suitable for different use-cases.
