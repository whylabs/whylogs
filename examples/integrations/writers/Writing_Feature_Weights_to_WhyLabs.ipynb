    "Feature Importance consists of a class of techniques that indicates the relative importance of each feature for a given prediction model. This is done by calculating and assigning a score, or weight, to each feature. Tracking the feature weights of a model can be useful for different reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Insights: By determining which features are more or less important to your task, a domain expert can make informed decisions, such as gathering more data or adding/removing different features.\n",
    "- Model Interpretability: Feature weights can provide insights into which features your model considers more or less relevant, improving the model's interpretability.\n",
    "- Model Upgrading: Feature weights can be the basis of further feature selection processes, removing unnecessary features, improving the maintainability and performance of your model.\n",

    "WhyLabs supports feature weight tracking and visualization at your monitoring dashboard. The most straightforward way to send and receive feature weights to WhyLabs is through whylogs, and that's exactly what we'll show in this example.\n",
