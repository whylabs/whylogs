    "In this example, we will show how to use whylogs and WhyLabs to monitor text data. We will use the [20 Newsgroups dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html) to train a classifier and monitor different aspects of the pipeline: we will monitor high dimensional embeddings, the list of tokens, and also the performance of the classifier itself. We will also inject an anomaly to see how we can detect it with WhyLabs. We will translate an increasingly large portion of documents from English to Spanish and see how the model performance degrades and how the embeddings change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To monitor the embeddings, we will first calculate a number of meaningful reference points. In this case, that means embeddings that represent each document topic. To do so, we will use the labeled data in our training dataset to calculate the centroids in PCA space for each topic. We will then compare each data point of a given batch to this set of reference embeddings. That way, we can calculate distribution metrics according to the distance of each reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tokenize each document and monitor the list of tokens. This is useful to detect changes in the vocabulary of the dataset, number of tokens per document, and other statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will monitor the performance of the classifier. We will log both predictions and labels for each batch, so we can calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score."
