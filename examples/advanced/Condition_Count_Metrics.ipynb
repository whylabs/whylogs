    "By default, whylogs tracks several metrics, such as type counts, distribution metrics, cardinality and frequent items. Those are general metrics that are useful for a lot of use cases, but often we need metrics tailored for our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Condition Count Metrics__ gives you the flexibility to define your own customized metrics. It will return the results as counters, which is the number of times the condition was met for a given column. With it, you can define conditions such as regex matching for strings, equalities or inequalities for numerical features, and even define your own function to check for any given condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create metrics for __regex matching__\n",
    "    - Examples: contains email/credit card number (String features)\n",
    "2. Create metrics for __(in)equalities__\n",
    "    - Examples: equal, less, greater, less than, greater than (Numerical features)\n",
    "3. Combining metrics with __logic operators__ (and, or, not)\n",
    "    - Examples: Between range, outside of range, not equal (Numerical features)\n",
    "4. Creating metrics with __custom functions__\n",
    "    - Examples: is even number, is text preprocessed (Any type)\n",
    "5. Going Further: Combining this example with other whylogs' features\n",
