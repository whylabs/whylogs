.. py:data:: Row

   

.. py:data:: TrackData

   

.. py:class:: DatasetProfileContainer(dataset_timestamp: int, schema: Optional[whylogs.core.DatasetSchema])

   A container that abstracts over different types of profiles.

   This does the work of deciding how to track data and how to create profiles given a DatasetSchema.
   This can only be used to manage a single entity for a given time. For example, this can represent
   a normal DatasetProfile or segment that has a given dataset timestamp.

   .. py:method:: track(data: TrackData) -> None

      Track data against the contained profile or segment.


   .. py:method:: to_result_set() -> whylogs.api.logger.result_set.ResultSet

      Get the ResultSet of the contained profile/segment.

      This doesn't have any side effects. It generates a ResultSet of whatever
      is inside when this is called.



.. py:class:: TrackMessage

   Send some data to be tracked.

   .. attribute:: data

      The data to be tracked.

   .. attribute:: timestamp_ms

      The time in milliseconds when the data occurred.

   .. attribute:: result

      an optional Future that is fulfilled when the track has completed. It will either
      be a success (None) or a failure (Exception).

   .. py:attribute:: data
      :type: TrackData

      

   .. py:attribute:: timestamp_ms
      :type: int

      

   .. py:attribute:: result
      :type: Optional[concurrent.futures.Future[None]]

      


.. py:class:: FlushMessage

   Trigger a flush, converting all managed profiles to result sets and attempt to write them if there are writers.


.. py:class:: LoggerStatus

   Various status metrics.

   This returns various metadata about the current state. Useful for logging, testing, and debugging.

   .. attribute:: dataset_timestamps

      The amount of dataset timestamps being managed. Each of these will map
      to either a profile or a segment.

   .. attribute:: dataset_profiles

      The amount of dataset profiles being managed. One of these is created for
      each time period that the logger is configured to manage. For example, if the logger is configured
      to aggregate by hour and TrackMessages come in for two hours, then there will be two of these.

   .. attribute:: segment_caches

      Same as dataset_profiles, but for segments.

   .. attribute:: writers

      Amount of writers that the logger is configured to have.

   .. attribute:: pending_writables

      The amount of items that have been flushed but have not yet been written.

   .. py:attribute:: dataset_timestamps
      :type: int

      

   .. py:attribute:: dataset_profiles
      :type: int

      

   .. py:attribute:: segment_caches
      :type: int

      

   .. py:attribute:: writers
      :type: int

      

   .. py:attribute:: pending_writables
      :type: int

      


.. py:class:: StatusMessage

   Get various status metrics.

   .. py:attribute:: result
      :type: concurrent.futures.Future[LoggerStatus]

      


.. py:class:: PendingWritable

   .. py:attribute:: attempts
      :type: int

      

   .. py:attribute:: writable
      :type: whylogs.api.writer.writer.Writable

      


.. py:data:: LoggerMessage

   

.. py:class:: MultiDatasetRollingLogger(aggregate_by: whylogs.api.logger.experimental.multi_dataset_logger.time_util.TimeGranularity = TimeGranularity.Hour, write_schedule: whylogs.api.logger.experimental.multi_dataset_logger.time_util.Schedule = Schedule(cadence=TimeGranularity.Minute, interval=10), schema: Optional[whylogs.core.DatasetSchema] = None, writers: List[whylogs.api.writer.Writer] = [])

   Bases: :py:obj:`whylogs.api.logger.experimental.multi_dataset_logger.message_processor.MessageProcessor`\ [\ :py:obj:`LoggerMessage`\ ]

   A logger that manages profiles and segments for various dataset timestamps.

   This logger manages a map of dataset timestamp to dataset profile/segment and handles proper
   logging to each type. Given a TimeGranularity to aggregate by, for each call to track(), roughly
   the following will happen:

       - The timestamp_ms will be truncated to the start of the day/hour (depending on aggregate_by). This
           is the dataset timestamp.
       - That dataset timestamp is used as the key to either create a dataset profile/segment, or to add
           the current data to.

   The logger also periodically attempts to write out the internal state according to the write_schedule. It
   will attempt to write three times before considering a result set unwritable and dropping it. o

   The logger is associated with one or no dataset schema as well. That will determine if the logger creates
   normal profiles or segments internally, among other things.

   .. py:property:: name

      A string used for identification purposes only.

      It has no semantics. Multiple threads may be given the same name. The
      initial name is set by the constructor.

   .. py:property:: ident

      Thread identifier of this thread or None if it has not been started.

      This is a nonzero integer. See the get_ident() function. Thread
      identifiers may be recycled when a thread exits and another thread is
      created. The identifier is available even after the thread has exited.

   .. py:property:: daemon

      A boolean value indicating whether this thread is a daemon thread.

      This must be set before start() is called, otherwise RuntimeError is
      raised. Its initial value is inherited from the creating thread; the
      main thread is not a daemon thread and therefore all threads created in
      the main thread default to daemon = False.

      The entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left.

   .. py:method:: log(data: TrackData, timestamp_ms: Optional[int] = None, sync: bool = False) -> None

      Log some data.

      :param data: The data to log. This can either be a pandas data frame, a row (dictionary of str to str/int/float/etc),
                   or a list of rows.
      :param timestamp_ms: The timestamp of the data. If this isn't supplied then it is assumed to have happened now.
      :param sync: Whether or not to perform this action synchronously. By default, this is an asynchronous operation.
                   You can make this synchronous in order to react to errors. Mostly useful when initially setting up
                   logging since the only errors that can be responded to are data format related.


   .. py:method:: flush() -> None

      Flush the internal state, causing everything to be written using the configured writers.


   .. py:method:: run() -> None

      Method representing the thread's activity.

      You may override this method in a subclass. The standard run() method
      invokes the callable object passed to the object's constructor as the
      target argument, if any, with sequential and keyword arguments taken
      from the args and kwargs arguments, respectively.



   .. py:method:: send(message: Union[MessageType, CloseMessage]) -> None


   .. py:method:: close() -> None


   .. py:method:: start()

      Start the thread's activity.

      It must be called at most once per thread object. It arranges for the
      object's run() method to be invoked in a separate thread of control.

      This method will raise a RuntimeError if called more than once on the
      same thread object.



   .. py:method:: join(timeout=None)

      Wait until the thread terminates.

      This blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is
      called terminates -- either normally or through an unhandled exception
      or until the optional timeout occurs.

      When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
      floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
      (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call
      is_alive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the
      thread is still alive, the join() call timed out.

      When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will
      block until the thread terminates.

      A thread can be join()ed many times.

      join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to join the current
      thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also an error to join() a
      thread before it has been started and attempts to do so raises the same
      exception.



   .. py:method:: is_alive()

      Return whether the thread is alive.

      This method returns True just before the run() method starts until just
      after the run() method terminates. See also the module function
      enumerate().



   .. py:method:: isDaemon()


   .. py:method:: setDaemon(daemonic)


   .. py:method:: getName()


   .. py:method:: setName(name)
